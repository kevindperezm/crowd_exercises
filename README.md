Crowd Exercises
===============
A place for my Crowd training exercises.
----------------------------------------

A list of exercises stored here:
* <b>[Computer simulation](https://github.com/kevindperezm/crowd_exercises/tree/master/computer_simulation)</b>: a "coin flip" game, which I wrote, including its psuedo-random number generator.
* <b>[Palindromes](https://github.com/kevindperezm/crowd_exercises/tree/master/palindromes)</b>: a palindrome generator that takes strings in a file as input. It is designed to be reused and easy to extend.
* <b>[Missiles](https://github.com/kevindperezm/crowd_exercises/tree/master/missiles)</b>: An exercise where we're programming an anti-missile system that candecrease its altitude.
